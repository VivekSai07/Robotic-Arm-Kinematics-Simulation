# Robotic-Arm-Kinematics-Simulation
Welcome to the Robotic Arm Kinematics Simulation repository! This project features MATLAB Live Scripts (.mlx) that provide a visual representation of the kinematics of 2-DOF and 3-DOF robotic arms in a 2-dimensional space. Explore different arm configurations and observe how various parameters impact the arm's movement in real-time.
